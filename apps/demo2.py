                    # Module 1: Previous Year Analysis with 2020 Budget 
                    #
                    ## Description
                    Module 1 focuses on the year wise analysis of various department budgets ranging from year 1941- 2024 along with a detailed graph of predictive analysis for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024.
                    
                    ## Inference
                    ->   Through the visualisations, A rolling mean has been set to determine the progress of the department budgets over the years which pitfalls from the year 1944 - 1950 signifying the independence and change in economic legislature, The graph plateaus from the year 1991 to 2012 with short increments every 5 years. This data represents that the economy booms in the first year of the elected governments. 
                    
                    ->   From 2009 to 2020, We can observe that National Defence has been at the forefront of the economic gains made per 1 Crore INR followed by Social Security, Veterans Benefits (in- line with OROP) and Health and Medicine sector. The lowest of the interests include Education and Energy sector with nominal gains in Transportation sector
                    
                    ->   W.R.T COVID-19 - Now, while the country is deeply affected by Covid-19 and there is a huge shortage of medical supplies everywhere, it does make us wonder that if the government had spent more on healthcare, we would have perhaps been in a better situation.
