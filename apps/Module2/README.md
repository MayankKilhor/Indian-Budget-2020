# Module 2:  Budget Speech Text Visualization 

## Description
Speech analysis of the speakers often tends to the interests of the governments for the planned years and can give a significant insight into where the common man can expect changes and increments over the course of the year. Hence analysis of the Budget speech is crucial in understanding the ideology of the government as well as the sectors that the budget will focus on in the forefront which helps in future planning and social security for the middle class.


## Inference
->   The text visualisation shows that the speaker has focused heavily on Tax, coming from 2018-2019 where GST was first enforced nationwide we can see how the government is trying to change certain parameters to smoothen the process of tax elevations, followed by tax is the word Proposed, Signifying that the government is ambitious and looks ahead in the long run, judging by the current trends in the economy and flailing opportunities for employment, it shows that schemes are being proposed but not followed through.

->   Shallow Promises often lead to the demise of trust in the government. Furthermore we can see that a lot of comparison has been done from the previous year and the word government comes up often.
