The main reason for focusing on Healthcare budget is to better analyse how the government has been allocated budget for healthcare. Post Pandemic the economy had gone into a spiral with India noting first ever Quarterly fall and prediction of -9% decrement in the GDP, Hence to recover economy as well as making sure that India comes out stronger from the pandemic it is of utmost importance to see how well the Healthcare sector is doing and how 2021 budget shall be allocated funds in order to tackle the global pandemic situation.


## Inference
->   Over the last three years 2018, 2019, 2020 we can observe that the budget allocation has incremented from 51,000 Crore INR to 62,000 Crore INR. A net increase of almost 10,000 Crore INR. This is however in contrast with the amount spent on the Education sector as well as the Transportation sector.

->   A country of 135 Billion with the modern statistics showing that we have 1 Doctor for over 50 people is an alarming number.

->   Most of the Healthcare budget has been spent on acquisition of modern technology machines such as MRI machines, Few have been allocated to the building of new hospitals.
