 # Module 3: Department- wise Budget Expenditure Allocation 

## Description
This module focuses mainly on the various ministries and departments in the budget allocation and represents information that is descriptive of the interest levied onto these ministries. 

## Inference
->   Force directed graphs have been used to identify all the departments and ministries that gain interest from the budget allocations levied onto them, not only giving us a clue at the sheer number of sub groups but also what goes where

->   It is to be noted that Union Territories perform higher in this regard as the geographical landscape followed by tourism as well as faster development rate signifies growth in sectors such as Shipping, Healthcare, Power. The revised budget has just 2 instances where a significant change is made. - 1) Central Vigilance Commission 2) Defence pensions

->   A stark contrast can be seen in the heatmap where over 2000 Crore has been spent on Other Establishments which shows the government wishes to spend a good amount on payments and obtaining more capital.
